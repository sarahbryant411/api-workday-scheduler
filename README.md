# api-workday-scheduler

## The challenge was to create a work day scheduler that would display the current day at the top of the calendar. You are also presented time blocks for standard business hours of 9am-5pm. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future. You can enter an event and then the text in that block is saved in local storage and even when you refresh the page the saved events persist.
